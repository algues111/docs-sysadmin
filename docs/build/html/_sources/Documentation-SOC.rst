SIEM
===============

Fundamentals and basic terms
---------------------------------

"Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) encompasses the utilization of software offerings and solutions that merge the management of security data with the supervision of security events. 
These instruments facilitate real-time evaluations of alerts related to security, which are produced by network hardware and applications."

En d'autres termes, un SIEM est une solution permettant d'aggréger des logs de différents terminaux, périphériques et du réseau, de les traiter, les analyser et les traiter en conséquence.
Ce qui permet de faciliter la supervision de la sécurité d'une infrastructure informatique

SOC
================


"A Security Operations Center (SOC) is an essential facility that houses a team of information security experts responsible for continuously monitoring and evaluating an organization's security status. 
The main objective of a SOC team is to identify, examine, and address cybersecurity incidents by employing a mix of technology solutions and a comprehensive set of procedures.

Various technology solutions, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools, are utilized by the SOC team to monitor and identify security threats. 
They also make use of threat intelligence and engage in threat hunting initiatives to proactively detect potential threats and vulnerabilities."
